KNOWN ISSUES:

Devices with a bar on the side (ie Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S8+) have issues due to the extra screen space breaking aspect-ratio calculations

Devices with very high resolutions and/or unusual aspect ratios may also not function properly.
Arena battles sometimes get hung up. Cause unknown. Please share any observations!

NonceCents' TO DO LIST:

Test Chain Helper Manual Select in other resolutions. This feature uses hard-coded unit positions for best possible speed, but this could be a problem in higher resolutions.

Test in other resolutions, work on aRatio .. Update 9/3; improvements made to sb_reg definition, tested in multiple resolutions, awaiting user feedback
